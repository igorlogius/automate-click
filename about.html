<b>Q:</b> Why/When should i use this add-on and not "I don't care about
cookies".
<ol>
  <li>
    <b>A:</b> If the consent message you want to get rid of is not covered by
    "IDCAC" .
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>A:</b> If you want to automate clicks on other things than (just) cookie
    consent messages.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>A:</b> If the usage of "IDCAC" breaks the website functionality. AC might
    be an alternativ since it is less invasiv in terms of how it operates (for
    example it doesnt block webrequests)
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>A:</b> If you want an addon which requires as few addons permissions as
    necessary to to get the job done.
