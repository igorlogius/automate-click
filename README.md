This add-on can automate click actions that users might have to perform when visiting a website. For example accept or reject cookie consent messages.

<b>Q:</b> Why/When should i use this add-on and not "I don't care about cookies".
<ol>
<li>
<b>A:</b> If the consent message you want to get rid of is not covered by "IDCAC" .  
</li>
<li>
<b>A:</b> If you want to automate clicks on other things than (just) cookie consent messages. 
</li>
<li>
<b>A:</b> If the usage of "IDCAC" breaks the website functionality. AC might be an alternativ since it is  less invasiv in terms of how it operates  (for example it doesnt  block webrequests) 
</li>
<li>
<b>A:</b> If you want an addon which requires as few addons permissions as necessary to to get the job done.
