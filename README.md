<b>Q:</b> Why/When should i use this add-on and not "I don't care about
cookies".
<ol>
  <li>
    <b>A:</b> If the consent message you want to get rid of is not covered by
    "IDCAC" .
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>A:</b> If you want to automate clicks on other things than (just) cookie
    consent messages.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>A:</b> If the usage of "IDCAC" breaks the website functionality. AC might
    be an alternativ since it is less invasiv in terms of how it operates (for
    example it doesnt block webrequests)
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>A:</b> If you want an addon which requires as few addons permissions as
    necessary to to get the job done.

    <li><b>Can/Should  i trust this addon?</b>
        You can view the source code by either visiting the Homepage/Support Site or just saving/downloading the XPI (which is really just a ZIP Archive) and then extract it locally. The Sources in the XPI should be unofuscated and unminified (HTML,CSS and JS), so it's as easy to read as possible. Alternatives you can also use the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/crxviewer/">CRX Viewer Extension by Rob W</a> to inspect the XPI sources. If you have an questions, you can also open an issue on the support site and i'll try and answer to the best of my abilities.
        If you are no programmer and are still feeling unsure, you might want to visit one of the official or unoffical mozilla communities and ask if someone there with more knowlege can take a look. Examples: https://reddit.com/r/firefox , https://lemmy.world/c/firefox or https://chat.mozilla.org/#/room/#addons:mozilla.org
